This specification is written in collaboration with the development communities
of the major open-source toolchain and operating system communities, and as
such specifies what has been agreed upon and implemented. As a result, any
changes to this specification that are not backwards-compatible would break ABI
compatibility for those toolchains, which is not permitted unless for features
explicitly marked as experimental, and so will not be made unless absolutely
necessary, regardless of whether the specification is a pre-release version,
ratified version or anything in between. This means any version of this
specification published at the above link can be regarded as stable in the
technical sense of the word (but not necessarily in the official RISC-V
International specification state meaning), with the official specification
state being an indicator of the completeness, clarity and general editorial
quality of the specification.
